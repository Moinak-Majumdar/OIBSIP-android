# Oasis Infobyte

### Welcome to my Android Development Internship of ```Oasis Infobyte```. This Project contains multiple tusks developed using flutter.

#### Here I have to complete 3 out of 5 given tusks. Tusks I have completed are following - 

1. **Unit Converter**: A Flutter app that allows you to convert various units, such as Distance, Weight, Temperature and Time.

2. **Quiz App**: A quiz application where users can answer a series of questions and receive a score at the end.

3. **Stopwatch**: A stopwatch app that allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer.

4. **Calculator**: Additionally I have created this, This app is capable of solving basic arithmetic operations.
